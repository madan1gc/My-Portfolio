# Content To-Do

Every item below is placeholder or unconfirmed content shipped intentionally
so the site's structure could be reviewed immediately (spec §4, §7). Nothing
here should be treated as final copy.

## Blocking (site is not truly launch-ready without these)

- [ ] Add the real résumé PDF at `public/resume/Madan-GC-Resume.pdf`
      (referenced by `data/profile.ts` → `resumeUrl`).
- [ ] Replace the placeholder domain `https://madangc.example` with the real
      production domain in `app/layout.tsx` (`metadataBase`), `app/sitemap.ts`,
      `app/robots.ts`, and the `PersonJsonLd` block in `app/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Confirm `/images/me.jpg` is an appropriate professional headshot for the
      Hero photo — the original site's alt text called it "Mountain
      landscape," so verify it's actually a headshot before launch.
- [ ] The Home page's nav (`components/layout/Nav.tsx`) links to
      `/open-source`, `/community`, and `/blog`, none of which exist yet
      (they're built in Phases 3-4). `/work` now exists as of Phase 2. Either
      add stub "Coming soon" pages for the remaining three routes, or do not
      deploy the site publicly, until those routes exist.

## Content quality

Site works without these, but they're the difference between "structurally
complete" and "actually persuasive".

- [ ] Confirm or replace the "Plugin Author" hero stat in
      `data/profile.ts` → `getHeroStats()` (currently "In progress" and
      flagged `placeholder: true`). Remove it if no plugin will be published.
- [ ] Replace all three entries in `data/testimonials.ts` with real
      client/teammate/community quotes.
- [ ] Confirm WordCamp Nepal / WordCamp Asia attendance before adding them to
      `data/trust.ts` — only Codewing Solutions, WordPress.org, and WordCamp
      Kathmandu are listed today because they're confirmed.
- [ ] The Hero's status badge text "Available for freelance & full-time
      roles" (`components/sections/Hero.tsx`) should be confirmed as still
      accurate before launch — it's an availability claim, not a
      placeholder, but worth a pre-launch check.
- [ ] No favicon or Open Graph/Twitter metadata exists yet (`app/layout.tsx`)
      — spec §8 calls for OG image generation; this was out of scope for
      Phase 1's "SEO basics" but should be tracked for a later phase.
- [ ] All 7 case studies in `data/projects.ts` (`/work` and `/work/[slug]`)
      have realistic-sounding placeholder copy for overview, challenge,
      approach, results, and key learnings, plausible but unverified
      `techStack` guesses, and no real screenshots, GitHub repos, or live
      URLs. Every field needs review against the real project before these
      are presented as verified work. The 3 featured on the Home page
      (`mgcora-unused-media-finder`, `trailvista-theme`, `codewing-website`)
      are an editorial placeholder choice too — revisit once real results
      exist.

## Later phases (tracked here now, addressed when that phase is built)

- [ ] Phase 3 — Open Source & Community: real WordPress.org contribution
      history, plugin/theme downloads, WordCamp roles/years/photos.
- [ ] Phase 4 — Blog: the 5 recommended articles need to actually be written.
